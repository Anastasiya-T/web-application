	"	<p>On my morning commute last week I decided to dip into a bit of 18th-century philosophy: Hume’s fork, Kant’s Critique of Pure Reason. Then I veered off into some physics: Newton’s law of universal gravitation, Einstein’s theory of general relativity.</p><p>But what’s even more remarkable than my geekiness is the fact that I did all this on my smartphone. The articles were on Wikipedia. And I started out not with a planned reading list but with Google.</p><p>In those ancient days before smartphones, wifi on public transport, and, of course, the internet, I would have needed to go to a library to read up on such an eclectic range of topics.</p> "
